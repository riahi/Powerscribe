PROCEDURE: The procedure itself was explained to the patient carefully. The risks, benefits, and alternatives to ultrasound-guided thoracentesis was discussed with the patient, and written informed consent was obtained. The patient was brought into the ultrasound suite and a time-out was performed. The patient was positioned supine on the table. Preliminary ultrasound of the pleural space was performed and [] effusion was noted. The most appropriate approach for safe needle entry site was planned and the site for puncture was marked. The [] posterior chest wall was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Subcutaneous 2% lidocaine was used for local anesthesia along the expected needle tract. 

Under ultrasound-guidance, an 5 French x 7cm Yueh needle-sheath was inserted carefully into the pleural space towards the pleural effusion.  The needle was removed and the sheath was connected to a syringe.  Approximately [] of pleural fluid was aspirated and sent to pathology for chemistry, microbiology, and cytology. Next, the Yueh sheath was connected to tubing and a vacuum suction device. A total of [] cc of [] pleural fluid was aspirated. The sheath was removed and a sterile dressing applied.
