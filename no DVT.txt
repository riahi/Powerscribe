Real-time grayscale ultrasound scanning and ultrasound Doppler analysis of the [left or right] thigh deep veins was performed.

The [left or right] common femoral vein, superficial femoral vein and the popliteal vein all show normal compressibility. They also demonstrate normal respiratory phasicity and augmentibility of their flow signal.

Impression:

No evidence of DVT of [left or right] thigh deep veins.
