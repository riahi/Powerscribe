CLINICAL HISTORY AND INDICATIONS: 

PRE-PROCEDURAL CONSIDERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT: [ Pre-procedural coagulation parameters and platelet count were within acceptable limits.]

PROCEDURE(S): CT-guided biopsy of 
	
CONSENT: Informed consent was obtained from [] by Dr. [].  The indication(s) for the procedure(s), alternative options, attendant risks, and potential complications were discussed in detail and questions answered.  [A []-speaking interpreter was present and facilitated communication]. A team time-out was performed prior to [sedation and] beginning the procedure to verify the correct patient, procedure and position.

CONTRAST: [none; Ultravist 370, __ ml]

GUIDANCE MODALITY:  CT / CT fluoroscopy / US

DEVICES: 
Temno 17 G /  cm introducer 
Temno 18 G /   cm coaxial spring-loaded core biopsy needle 
22 G /  cm Chiba x 
20 G /  cm Chiba x 
25 G /  cm Chiba x 

SEDATION/ANESTHESIA:[none, conscious IV sedation administered and monitored by the radiology department nurse with supervision by the radiologist, monitored anesthesia care (MAC) provided by the anesthesia department, general endotracheal tube anesthesia provided by the anesthesia department]

DURATION of SEDATION/ANESTHESIA: 

MEDICATIONS AND DOSAGES: 
Midazolam [] mg IV
Fentanyl [] ug IV
2% lidocaine and sodium bicarbonate in a 4:1 mixture, [] ml for subcutaneous local anesthesia

ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST: Dr. [] was present for the entire radiologic portion of the procedure(s).

RESIDENT/FELLOW:  []

IMAGING FINDINGS:  []

PROCEDURE:  With the patient in a [supine, prone, right lateral decubitus, left lateral decubitus, prone oblique] position on the CT table, preliminary CT images were acquired with a radioopaque grid. The [ ] lesion was located and measured [   ]. After assessing the most direct access to the lesion, the skin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. All elements of sterile barrier technique followed including: hand hygiene, sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis. This was followed by injection of the local anesthetic solution into the skin and subcutaneous tissues.  A small incision was made followed by insertion of the [] needle under CT / CT fluoroscopy guidance.  [The __ needle was then inserted in coaxial fashion and a biopsy from the mass was obtained.]  [An additional __ needle was inserted into the mass in tandem fashion.]  This was repeated for a total of [] biopsy samples.  [Preliminary assessment by the on-site cytopathology technologist confirmed/did not confirm adequacy of the specimen for diagnosis.  Additional material was submitted in solution for cell block analysis.]  [Core tissue specimens were submitted in formalin for histopathology assessment.]  The biopsy needle was removed and a sterile bandage applied.
	
SPECIMENTS SENT:[none, Cytopathology, Histopathology, Microbiology, Chemistry, other]

COMPLICATIONS: Post-procedure CT images demonstrate [].  [The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications].

POST-PROCEDURE OBSERVATION: The patient will be [observed in the radiology recovery area for [] hours prior to discharge./admitted for overnight observation prior to discharge in the morning.  Post-procedure orders have been written/entered into BICS]

FOLLOW-UP PLAN: The patient will follow-up with the referring clinician for biopsy results and further management.

CONCLUSION:  
CT-guided biopsy of the [ ] was [performed without difficulty].
