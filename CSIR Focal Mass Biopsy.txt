PROCEDURE:  

The patient was placed in the [] position on the procedure table.  Preliminary imaging was obtained to confirm the [] mass and to determine the approach.  All elements of appropriate sterile preparation and technique were followed pertaining to the operators, patient, equipment and supplies. The local anesthetic was administered and a small incision made.  The [] needle was inserted using imaging guidance.  [The __ needle was then inserted in coaxial fashion and a biopsy from the mass was obtained.]  [An additional __ needle was inserted into the mass in tandem fashion.]  This was repeated for a total of [] biopsy samples.  [Preliminary assessment by the on-site cytopathologist confirmed/did not confirm adequacy of the specimen for diagnosis.  Additional material was submitted in solution for cell block analysis.]  [Core tissue specimens were submitted in formalin for histopathology assessment.]  The biopsy needle was removed and a sterile bandage applied.
