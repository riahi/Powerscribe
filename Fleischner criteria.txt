If not previously performed, this may be further evaluated as follows, according to Fleischner criteria recommendations for follow-up of incidental CT nodules (H MacMahon, Guidelines for management of small pulmonary nodules detected on CT scans: A statement from the Fleischner Society, Radiology 237: 395-400 2005):

Low Risk Patients

Nodule size 
</= 4 mm    No follow-up needed
>4-6 mm     Follow-up CT at 12 months, if unchanged no further follow-up 
>6-8 mm     Initial Follow-up at 6-12 months, then 18-24 months if no change
> 8 mm       F/U CT around 3, 9, 24 mo, dynamic contrast enhanced CT, PET, and/or biopsy

High Risk  Patients

Nodule Size
</= 4 mm    F/U at 12 mo, if not change, no further follow-up
>4-6 mm     Initial F/U CT at 6-12 mo then at 18-24 mo if no change
>6-8 mm     Initial F/U CT at 3-6 mo then at 9-12 mo and 24 mo if no change
>8 mm        Same as low risk patients
