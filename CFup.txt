-Follow-up on lab results.
-Percutaneous drainage catheter - drain to gravity.
-Interventional radiology catheter(s) Input and Output q shift
-After aspirating the catheter, flush catheter with 10 mL (5 mL towards the catheter, 5 mL towards the drainage bag) of normal saline q 8 hour. Do not aspirate after flush.
-CSIR team will follow-up for catheter care and management.
-A follow-up CT can be considered when the catheter output drops to less than 10 cc of nonpurulent fluid per day for at least 2 consecutive days, for assessing residual / resolution of collection. 
-Considering the proximity to the bowel, once the collection is considered completely drained, an fluoroscopy abscessagram can be performed to evaluate for any fistulous communication with the bowel. 
-When the patient is planned for discharge, and if the catheter is still in place, please notify the CSIR team (B 14520) so that we can plan for outpatient follow-up.
