CONTRAST: []

GUIDANCE MODALITY: CT / CT-fluoroscopy / US

DEVICES: 
[ ]

SEDATION/ANESTHESIA:  None, conscious IV sedation administered and monitored by the radiology department nurse with supervision by the radiologist, monitored anesthesia care (MAC) provided by the anesthesia department, general endotracheal tube anesthesia provided by the anesthesia department

DURATION of SEDATION/ANESTHESIA: [ ]

MEDICATIONS AND DOSAGES: 
Midazolam [] mg IV
Fentanyl [] ug IV
2% lidocaine and sodium bicarbonate in a 4:1 mixture, [] ml for subcutaneous local anesthesia

PREPROCEDURE IMAGING FINDINGS:  [] dated [] revealed [].

PROCEDURE:  With the patient in a [] position on the [US/CT] table, preliminary [CT images were acquired with a radioopaque grid / US images were acquired]. The [ ] mass was located and measured [ ]. After assessing the most direct access to the mass, the skin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. All elements of sterile barrier technique followed including: hand hygiene, sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis. This was followed by injection of the local anesthetic solution into the skin and subcutaneous tissues.  A small incision was made followed by insertion of the [] needle under [US / CT / CT fluoroscopy guidance] through [] approach.  The [] needle was then inserted in coaxial fashion and a biopsy from the [ ] mass was obtained.  [An additional __ needle was inserted into the mass in tandem fashion.]  This was repeated for a total of [] biopsy samples. [Preliminary assessment by the on-site cytopathologist [confirmed / did not confirm] adequacy of the specimen for diagnosis. [Additional material was submitted in solution for cell block analysis.]  [Large needle tissue specimens were submitted in formalin for histopathology assessment.]  The biopsy needle was removed and a sterile bandage applied.
