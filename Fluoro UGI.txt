TECHNIQUE: The patient was given oral barium contrast to swallow under intermittent fluoroscopic observation. Multiple digital radiographs of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum were obtained.

FINDINGS: 
The patient swallowed barium without difficulty. The swallowing mechanism is normal.  Esophageal motility is normal.

The esophagus is normal in distensibility and contour. 

The esophageal mucosal appears normal.

The gastroesophageal junction appears normal. 

There is no evidence of the hiatus hernia or gastroesophageal reflux. 

Contrast passes readily into the stomach without delay. Gastric and duodenal mucosal fold patterns are within normal limits.  Normal distensibility and peristalsis noted.

Visualized small bowel loops appear unremarkable.


IMPRESSION: [<Normal upper gastrointestinal series.>]
