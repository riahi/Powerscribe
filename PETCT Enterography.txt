INDICATION: Crohn's disease.

This study was performed as part of a research protocol, F350514. There is no charge for the midportion of the study. The principal investigator is Paul Shyn MD.  Informed consent was obtained for this PHRC approved protocol.

A serum pregnancy test on the day of examination was negative. The patient received 13.0 mCi of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) intravenously. The contrast-enhanced CT portion of the study was obtained immediately prior to PET imaging on the PET/CT scanner.  See separately dictated CT enterography report. Approximately 90 minutes following FDG administration PET acquisitions were obtained with 4 minutes per bed position to include the abdomen and pelvis. The study is reviewed and PET-CT workstation including multiplanar displays.

There is diffuse moderate to intense FDG uptake throughout the distal one-third to one-half of the ileum. These bowel loops are located in the pelvis. The abnormal uptake extends all the way to the terminal ileum and ileocecal valve. The FDG uptake corresponds to areas of abnormality on CT Enterography. The there is  additional intense FDG uptake within a left perianal fistula which contains a seton. Mild to moderate FDG uptake throughout the rectum is not greater than commonly seen with physiologic uptake. Uptake in the remainder of the visualized bowel is normal.

No abnormal uptake identified in association with reactive mesenteric lymph nodes or the 1 cm peritoneal nodule in the right.

CONCLUSION: Abnormal FDG uptake corresponding to the distal one-third to one-half of the ileum including the terminal ileum and ileocecal valve. Findings likely reflect active inflammation of known Crohn's disease.
