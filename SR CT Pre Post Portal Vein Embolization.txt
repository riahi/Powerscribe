INDICATION: [ ]
 
TECHNIQUE: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained in arterial and portal venous phase [with/without] intravenous injection of [55 / 80 mL] [Ultravist / Isovue 300 / 370] and [with/without] [ ] enteric contrast material. 3D volume-rendered images and MIP images were generated by a technologist at a dedicated workstation in a 3D lab. 3D images are optimized to display arteries and veins and to calculate specific liver volumes.
