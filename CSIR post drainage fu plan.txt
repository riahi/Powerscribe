FOLLOW UP PLAN:  

This catheter will be left in place and orders for catheter irrigation with sterile saline, and monitoring of catheter outputs per shift have been written.  When catheter output is less than 10 cc of non-purulent fluid per day for at least two consecutive days, a follow-up CT scan will be considered to assess for fluid collection resolution. 

FOR CASES IN WHICH A FISTULA IS POSSIBLE OR KNOWN - PLEASE ADD THE FOLLOWING:

When the collection is considered fully drained, an abscessogram done under flouroscopy will be considered to evaluate for an ongoing fistula.

INCLUDE DISCHARGE PLANS:

When the patient is planned for discharge, and if the catheter is still in place, pls notify the CSIR team (B14520) at least a day in advance to arrange for discharge education, including catheter care, and plans for a follow-up visit with us.
