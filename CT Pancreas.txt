INDICATION: [<Pancreatic mass, pre-surgical evaluation>]

TECHNIQUE:  CT of abdomen and pelvis was performed in the arterial dominant, pancreatic parenchymal and portal venous phases after administration of intravenous contrast [ ] and oral contrast [  ]. Reformatted and MIP images were generated by a technologist at a dedicated workstation in a 3D lab.

Aberrant Anatomy []


Liver appears unremarkable, no focal hepatic lesion. 
Gallbladder is unremarkable.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilation.
Spleen is not enlarged, no focal lesion is seen.
Both adrenal are unremarkable, no adrenal nodules seen.
Both kidneys are normal in size and enhancement, no solid mass lesion, stones or hydronephrosis.
The stomach, small bowel, and large bowel within the abdomen demonstrate no thickening or dilatation.
No suspicious abdominal lymph nodes seen.
The vasculature enhances normally.
No free fluid or free air is seen.


Pelvis: 
Uterus, both ovaries and adnexa appear normal.
Prostate and seminal vesicles appear unremarkable.
Urinary bladder is well distended and appears unremarkable.
The small and large bowel within the pelvis demonstrate no abnormality.  Pelvic and inguinal lymph nodes are not enlarged.  
No free in the pelvis.

Soft Tissues and Bones:  


IMPRESSION:  
Evaluation is limited due to lack of intravenous contrast.
