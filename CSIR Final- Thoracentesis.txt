PREPROCEDURE IMAGING FINDINGS:  [CT / MRI / US / X-ray] dated [ ] revealed [ ].

PROCEDURE:  
Preliminary [US / CT] imaging used to assess the pleural fluid collection and to plan the approach revealed [mild / moderate / large] [left / right] pleural effusion.  With the patient sitting in an upright position, arms resting on a table, the skin over the [right/left] posterior chest wall was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. All elements of sterile barrier technique followed including: hand hygiene, sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis. The local anesthetic solution was injected into the skin and subcutaneous tissues.  A small incision was made followed by ultrasound-guided insertion of a 5 Fr centesis catheter over the top of the rib into the pleural fluid.  [] mL of [] fluid were removed followed by catheter removal.  A vaseline gauze and sterile bandage was applied.
