CSIR post drainage f/u plan
FOLLOW UP PLAN:  

This catheter will be left in place and orders for catheter irrigation with sterile saline, and monitoring of catheter outputs per shift have been written.  When catheter output is less than 10 cc of non-purulent fluid per day for at least two consecutive days, a follow-up CT scan will be considered to assess for fluid collection resolution. 

FOR CASES IN WHICH A FISTULA IS POSSIBLE OR KNOWN - PLEASE ADD THE FOLLOWING:

When the collection is considered fully drained, an abscessogram done under flouroscopy will be considered to evaluate for an ongoing fistula.

INCLUDE DISCHARGE PLANS:

When the patient is planned for discharge, and if the catheter is still in place, pls notify the CSIR team (B14520) at least a day in advance to arrange for discharge education, including catheter care, and plans for a follow-up visit with us.

CTC diagnostic
STUDY: Diagnostic CT Colonography

NOTE: CT Colonography has been shown in several studies to have high sensitivity in certain patient groups. Although the experience with this test is promising, the precise role of CT Colonography has not been established, particularly for lesions measuring 5 mm or less and for non-polypoid (flat) lesions. CT colonography is not intended for the detection of diminutive colonic polyps (i.e., tiny polyps <= 5 mm), the presence or absence of which will not change management of the patient.

INDICATION:  <<Clinical Information>>  

TECHNIQUE: The patient underwent bowel preparation the day before the exam, consisting of [ ]. Following automated carbon dioxide insufflation per rectum, supine and prone CT images were obtained before and after IV injection of 100 cc of Ultravist 300. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were performed on the CT console by the technologist. Additional 3D images were performed and evaluated using a dedicated 3D workstation by a radiologist to better assess the colon. Evaluation of the colon was performed using 2-D axial and multiplanar reformats, as well as 3-D images.

IMPRESSION:

COLONIC FINDINGS AND FOLLOW UP RECOMMENDATION:

[- Inadequate study or awaiting prior comparisons 
Inadequate prep with moderate to large amount of retained fecal material and/ or fluid present. Inadequate insufflation with one or more colonic segments collapsed on both views. The retained stool and/or insufficient distention severely limit the evaluation for polyps. No large lesions are identified; however the exam is insufficient to exclude polyps or small cancers. The patient should undergo optical colonoscopy after a sufficient colonic preparation. CT Colonography can be substituted for optical colonoscopy if the patient is either unable or unwilling to undergo optical colonoscopy.]

[- No polyp measuring 6 mm or greater and benign findings (e.g. colonic lipoma and colonic diverticula). Recommend continued colorectal cancer screening with optical colonoscopy in 10 years or with CT colonography in 5 years.]

[-Polyp measuring 6 mm or greater. Immediate optical colonoscopy with polypectomy is recommended.]

CTC screening

STUDY: Screening CT Colonography

NOTE: CT Colonography has been shown in several studies to have high sensitivity in certain patient groups. Although the experience with this test is promising, the precise role of CT Colonography has not been established, particularly for lesions measuring 5 mm or less and for non-polypoid (flat) lesions. CT colonography is not intended for the detection of diminutive colonic polyps (i.e., tiny polyps <= 5 mm), the presence or absence of which will not change management of the patient.

INDICATION:  [Asymptomatic patient screening for colorectal cancer.] 

TECHNIQUE: The patient underwent bowel preparation the day before the exam, consisting of [ ]. Following automated carbon dioxide insufflation per rectum, supine and prone CT images were obtained without intra venous contrast material administration. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were performed on the CT console by the technologist. Additional 3D images were performed and evaluated using a dedicated 3D workstation by a radiologist to better assess the colon. Evaluation of the colon was performed using 2-D axial and multiplanar reformats, as well as 3-D images.

FINDINGS: 
Note: Extracolonic evaluation is limited by the low dose CT technique and lack of IV contrast.

[Comment of quality of prep and distention. Size, morphology, and location of any large (= 10 mm) or small (6-9 mm) polyps.]


IMPRESSION:

COLONIC FINDINGS AND FOLLOW UP RECOMMENDATION:

[- Inadequate study or awaiting prior comparisons 
Inadequate prep with moderate to large amount of retained fecal material and/ or fluid present. Inadequate insufflation with one or more colonic segments collapsed on both views. The retained stool and/or insufficient distention severely limit the evaluation for polyps. No large lesions are identified, however the exam is insufficient to exclude polyps or small cancers. The patient should undergo optical colonoscopy after a sufficient colonic preparation. CT Colonography can be substituted for optical colonoscopy if the patient is either unable or unwilling to undergo optical colonoscopy.]

[- No polyp measuring 6 mm or greater and benign findings (e.g. colonic lipoma and colonic diverticula). Recommend continued colorectal cancer screening with optical colonoscopy in 10 years or with CT colonography in 5 years.]

[-Polyp measuring 6 mm or greater. Immediate optical colonoscopy with polypectomy is recommended.]

[- Malignant-appearing colonic mass. Surgical consultation is recommended.]

Fleischner criteria recommendations for f/u of lung nodules
If not previously performed, these may be further evaluated as follows, according 
to Fleischner criteria recommendations for follow-up of incidental CT nodules (H MacMahon, Guidelines for management of small pulmonary nodules detected on CT scans: A statement from the Fleischner Society, Radiology 237: 395-400 2005): 

Low Risk Patient: Minimal or no smoking or other known risk factors for malignancy 
 <=4 mm: No follow-up needed. 
 >4-6 mm: Initial follow-up CT at 12 months; if unchanged, no further follow-up. 
 >6-8 mm: Initial follow-up CT at 6-12 months then at 18-24 mo if no change. 
 >8 mm: follow-up CT at \R\3, 9, 24 months, or PET and/or biopsy. 


 High Risk Patient: History of smoking or other known risk factors 
 <=4 mm: Follow-up at 12 months; if unchanged, no further follow-up. 
 >4-6 mm: Initial follow-up CT at 6-12 months then at 18-24 months if no change. 
 >6-8 mm: Initial follow-up CT at 3-6 months then at 9-12 and 24 months if no change. 
 >8 mm: Same as low risk patient. 

 Note: Nodule size measured as average of length and width. 
Ground glass or partly solid nodules may require longer follow-up 
to exclude indolent adenocarcinoma.
