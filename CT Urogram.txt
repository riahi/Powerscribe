HISTORY: [].

TECHNIQUE: CT scans were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis before and 100 second (through abdomen only) and 15 minutes after intravenous administration of [] mL of Ultravist 300. [Study was supplemented with 10 mg Lasix.]

FINDINGS:

Lung bases: The imaged portions of the bilateral lung bases are clear. There is no pleural of pericardial effusion.

Inguinal lymph nodes are not enlarged. No bony lesions concerning for malignancy are seen.

3D Reformations: 3D reconstructions of the kidneys and collecting system, including volume renderings, MIPs, and curved planar reformats, were performed by a 3D technologist in a 3D laboratory that was supervised by a radiologist. [No hydronephrosis is present.] [The collecting system is well-opacified and appears normal. No ureteral abnormalities or urothelial lesions are seen.]
