INDICATION:

TECHNIQUE: CT of the abdomen and pelvis were performed both before and after intravenous contrast [  ] and 10 mg of IV furosemide / 250 cc of intravenous saline, using the CT urography protocol. Maximum-intensity projection (MIP) and volume rendered images were performed on an independent workstation by a technologist in 3D lab which is monitored by a physician to evaluate the collecting system, ureters, and bladder. 

COMPARISON:

FINDINGS: 

Lung bases: Limted images through lung bases reveal 

Abdomen:

Gallbladder is unremarkable.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilation.
Pancreas reveals no mass or ductal dilation.
Spleen is not enlarged, no focal lesion is seen.
Both adrenal are unremarkable, no adrenal nodules seen.
Both kidneys are normal in size and enhancement, no solid mass lesion, stones or hydronephrosis.
The stomach, small bowel, and large bowel within the abdomen demonstrate no thickening or dilatation.
No suspicious abdominal lymph nodes seen.
The vasculature enhances normally.
No free fluid or free air is seen.


Pelvis: 
Uterus, both ovaries and adnexa appear normal.
Prostate and seminal vesicles appear unremarkable.
Urinary bladder is well distended and appears unremarkable.
The small and large bowel within the pelvis demonstrate no abnormality.  Pelvic and inguinal lymph nodes are not enlarged.  
No free in the pelvis.
