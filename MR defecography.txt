INDICATION:  [ ]

TECHNIQUE: Prior to the examination the patient drank 900 ml of water and then had 240 ml of ultrasound gel administered rectally. Multiple MR images were obtained in a 3.0 Tesla magnet of the patient at rest, squeezing, and straining in the prone position.

FINDINGS:

Rest (Images []): Rest images showed normal positions of the bladder, [], and anorectal junction in correlation with the pubococcygeal line. The anorectal junction projects approximately [] cm below the pubococcygeal line.

Squeezing (Images []): There is a normal indentation of the puborectalis muscle on the back wall of the rectum with the patient squeezing. There is an elevation of the anorectal junction to approximately [] centimeters below the pubococcygeal line.  The bladder and [] stay in a normal position.
