Platelets [ ], INR [ ]
Allergies: [ ]
	
CONSENT: Informed consent was obtained from [] by Dr. [].  The indication(s) for the procedure(s), alternative options, attendant risks, and potential complications were discussed in detail and questions answered.  [A []-speaking interpreter was present and facilitated communication]. A team time-out was performed prior to [sedation and] beginning the procedure to verify the correct patient, procedure and position.

CONTRAST: [none; Ultravist 370, __ ml]

GUIDANCE MODALITY: [CT / CT fluoroscopy / US]

DEVICES: 
Temno 17 G / [ ] cm introducer 
Temno 18 G / [ ] cm coaxial spring-loaded core biopsy needle 
18 G / [ ] cm Chiba
22 G / [ ] cm Chiba 
20 G / [ ] cm Chiba 
25 G / [ ] cm Chiba 

SEDATION/ANESTHESIA: [none, conscious IV sedation administered and monitored by the radiology department nurse with supervision by the radiologist, monitored anesthesia care (MAC) provided by the anesthesia department, general endotracheal tube anesthesia provided by the anesthesia department]

DURATION of SEDATION/ANESTHESIA: [ ]

MEDICATIONS AND DOSAGES: 
Midazolam [] mg IV
Fentanyl [] mcg IV
2% lidocaine and sodium bicarbonate in a 4:1 mixture, [] ml for subcutaneous local anesthesia

PREPROCEDURE IMAGING FINDINGS:  [CT / MRI] dated [ ] revealed [ ].

PROCEDURE:  With the patient in a [prone, right lateral decubitus, left lateral decubitus, prone oblique] position on the [US/CT] table, preliminary [CT images were acquired with a radioopaque grid / US images were acquired]. The [ ] mass was located and measured [ ]. After assessing the most direct access to the mass, the skin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. All elements of sterile barrier technique followed including: hand hygiene, sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis. This was followed by injection of the local anesthetic solution into the skin and subcutaneous tissues.  A small incision was made followed by insertion of the [] needle under [US / CT / CT fluoroscopy guidance] through [approach--- ].  [The __ needle was then inserted in coaxial fashion and a biopsy from the [ ] mass was obtained.]  [An additional __ needle was inserted into the mass in tandem fashion.]  This was repeated for a total of [] biopsy samples. [Preliminary assessment by the on-site cytopathology technologist [confirmed / did not confirm] adequacy of the specimen for diagnosis. [Additional material was submitted in solution for cell block analysis.]  [Large needle tissue specimens were submitted in formalin for histopathology assessment.]  The biopsy needle was removed and a sterile bandage applied.
	
SPECIMENS SENT: [none, Cytopathology, Histopathology, Microbiology, Chemistry, other]

COMPLICATIONS: Post-procedure [US/ CT] images demonstrate [].  [The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications].

POST-PROCEDURE OBSERVATION: The patient will be [observed in the radiology recovery area for [] hours prior to [discharge / admission for overnight observation prior to discharge in the morning].  [This outpatient procedure did not require recovery room observation prior to discharge.  Home care instructions for this procedure were reviewed with the patient. All patient questions were answered.] 
Post-procedure orders have been written/entered into BICS.

FOLLOW-UP PLAN: The patient will follow-up with the referring clinician for biopsy results and further management. He may resume normal daily activities within 24 hours and is instructed to contact the CSIR fellow on-call should he develop any concerning symptoms, as outlined in the discharge paperwork.

IMPRESSION:
