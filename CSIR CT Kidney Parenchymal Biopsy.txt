CLINICAL HISTORY AND INDICATION:  []

PRE-PROCEDURAL CONSIDERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT:  []

PROCEDURE(S):. CT-guided parenchymal biopsy of the [right, left, pelvic, transplant] kidney
	
CONSENT: Informed consent was obtained from [] by Dr. [].  The indication(s) for the procedure(s), alternative options, attendant risks, and potential complications were discussed in detail and questions answered.  [A []-speaking interpreter was present and facilitated communication]

CONTRAST: [none; Ultravist 370, __ ml]

GUIDANCE MODALITY:  [CT; US]

DEVICES: [Temno 17g introducer - 18g coaxial automated core biopsy set; Temno 18g automated core biopsy needle; ]

SEDATION/ANESTHESIA:[none, conscious IV sedation administered and monitored by the radiology department nurse with supervision by the radiologist, monitored anesthesia care (MAC) provided by the anesthesia department, general endotracheal tube anesthesia provided by the anesthesia department]

DURATION of SEDATION/ANESTHESIA: 

MEDICATIONS AND DOSAGES: [midazolam [] mg IV, fentanyl [] ug IV; 2% lidocaine and sodium bicarbonate in a 4:1 mixture, [] ml for subcutaneous local anesthesia]

ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST: Dr. [] was present for the entire radiologic portion of the procedure(s).

RESIDENT/FELLOW:  []

IMAGING FINDINGS:  []

PROCEDURE:  With the patient in a [prone, right lateral decubitus, left lateral decubitus, prone oblique] position on the CT table, the skin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Preliminary CT images were obtained to plan the approach, followed by injection of the local anesthetic solution into the skin and subcutaneous tissues.  A small incision was made followed by insertion of a 17g introducer needle under CT guidance.  An 18g core biopsy needle was then inserted in coaxial fashion and [two, three] samples from the renal cortex were obtained.  Immediate light microscopic assessment by the nephropathologist confirmed sufficient glomeruli for diagnosis in the tissue specimens.  The biopsy needle was removed and a sterile bandage applied.
	
SPECIMENS SENT:[none, cytopathology, histopathology, microbiology, chemistry, other]

COMPLICATIONS: Post-procedure CT images demonstrate [].  [The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications].

POST-PROCEDURE OBSERVATION: The patient will be [observed in the radiology recovery area for [] hours prior to discharge./admitted for overnight observation prior to discharge in the morning.  Post-procedure orders have been entered into BICS]

FOLLOW-UP PLAN: The patient will follow-up with the referring clinician for biopsy results and further management.

CONCLUSION:  CT-guided parenchymal biopsy of the kidney was [performed without difficulty].
