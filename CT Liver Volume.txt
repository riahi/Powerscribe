INDICATION: [Pre/Post portal vein embolization]

TECHNIQUE: CT of abdomen and pelvis was performed in the arterial and portal venous phases after administration of intravenous [  ] and oral contrast [  ].  3D volume-rendered images and MIP images were generated by a technologist at a dedicated workstation in a 3D lab.  3D images are optimized to display arteries and veins and to calculate specific liver volumes.

COMPARISON: 

FINDINGS:

Lung bases: Limted images through lung bases reveal 

Abdomen:  
Liver appears unremarkable, no focal hepatic lesion. 
Gallbladder is unremarkable.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilation.
Pancreas reveals no mass or ductal dilation.
Spleen is not enlarged, no focal lesion is seen.
Both adrenal are unremarkable, no adrenal nodules seen.
Both kidneys are normal in size and enhancement, no solid mass lesion, stones or hydronephrosis.
The stomach, small bowel, and large bowel within the abdomen demonstrate no thickening or dilatation.
No suspicious abdominal lymph nodes seen.
The vasculature enhances normally.
No free fluid or free air is seen.


Pelvis: 
Uterus, both ovaries and adnexa appear normal.
Prostate and seminal vesicles appear unremarkable.
Urinary bladder is well distended and appears unremarkable.
The small and large bowel within the pelvis demonstrate no abnormality.  Pelvic and inguinal lymph nodes are not enlarged.  
No free in the pelvis.
