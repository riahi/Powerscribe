INDICATION: [Pre/Post portal vein embolization]

CONTRAST: Ultravist, []

TECHNIQUE: CT scanning of the abdomen and pelvis was performed in the arterial and portal venous phases.  3D volume-rendered images and MIP images were generated by a technologist at a dedicated workstation in a 3D lab.  3D images are optimized to display arteries and veins and to calculate specific liver volumes.

COMPARISON: [<None>].

FINDINGS:

LUNG BASES: [<There is no pleural effusion or lung base nodule.>]
