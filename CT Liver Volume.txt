INDICATION:
[Pre/Post portal vein embolization]

CONTRAST:
Ultravist, []

TECHNIQUE:
CT scanning of the abdomen and pelvis was performed in the arterial and portal venous phases.  3D volume-rendered images and MIP images were generated by a technologist at a dedicated workstation in a 3D lab.  3D images are optimized to display arteries and veins and to calculate specific liver volumes.

COMPARISON: 
[<None>].

FINDINGS:
[ ]

LUNG BASES: 
[<There is no pleural effusion or lung base nodule.>]

ABDOMEN: 
[Liver appears unremarkable without focal hepatic lesion.] [Gallbladder is unremarkable. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilation.] [Pancreas reveals no mass or ductal dilation.] [Spleen is not enlarged without focal lesions  seen.]

[Both adrenals are unremarkable, no adrenal nodules seen.]
[Both kidneys are normal in size and enhancement, no solid mass lesion, stones or hydronephrosis.]

[The stomach, small bowel, and large bowel within the abdomen demonstrate no thickening or dilatation.]

[No suspicious abdominal lymph nodes seen.]

PELVIS: 
[Uterus, both ovaries and adnexa appear normal. / Prostate and seminal vesicles appear unremarkable.] [Urinary bladder is well distended and appears unremarkable.]
[The small and large bowel within the pelvis demonstrate no abnormality.]  [Pelvic and inguinal lymph nodes are not enlarged.] [No free fluid in the pelvis.]
