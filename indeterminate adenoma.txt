The adrenal lesion does not have the typical characteristics of a benign adenoma, although most lesions will ultimately prove to be benign. As the lesion is non-specific by imaging criteria, further evaluation is recommended as clinically indicated. A six-month follow-up, non-IV contrast, abdominal scan can be considered and, if indicated, an adrenal washout protocol. As these lesions may be hormonally active, endocrine evaluation is clinically indicated.
