CTC diagnostic
STUDY: Diagnostic CT Colonography

NOTE: CT Colonography has been shown in several studies to have high sensitivity in certain patient groups. Although the experience with this test is promising, the precise role of CT Colonography has not been established, particularly for lesions measuring 5 mm or less and for non-polypoid (flat) lesions. CT colonography is not intended for the detection of diminutive colonic polyps (i.e., tiny polyps <= 5 mm), the presence or absence of which will not change management of the patient.

INDICATION:  [ ]

TECHNIQUE: The patient underwent bowel preparation the day before the exam, consisting of [ ]. Following automated carbon dioxide insufflation per rectum, supine and prone CT images were obtained before and after IV injection of 100 cc of Ultravist 300. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were performed on the CT console by the technologist. Additional 3D images were performed and evaluated using a dedicated 3D workstation by a radiologist to better assess the colon. Evaluation of the colon was performed using 2-D axial and multiplanar reformats, as well as 3-D images.

COLONIC FINDINGS AND FOLLOW UP RECOMMENDATION:

[- Inadequate study or awaiting prior comparisons 
Inadequate prep with moderate to large amount of retained fecal material and/ or fluid present. Inadequate insufflation with one or more colonic segments collapsed on both views. The retained stool and/or insufficient distention severely limit the evaluation for polyps. No large lesions are identified; however the exam is insufficient to exclude polyps or small cancers. The patient should undergo optical colonoscopy after a sufficient colonic preparation. CT Colonography can be substituted for optical colonoscopy if the patient is either unable or unwilling to undergo optical colonoscopy.]

[- No polyp measuring 6 mm or greater and benign findings (e.g. colonic lipoma and colonic diverticula). Recommend continued colorectal cancer screening with optical colonoscopy in 10 years or with CT colonography in 5 years.]

[-Polyp measuring 6 mm or greater. Immediate optical colonoscopy with polypectomy is recommended.]

[- Malignant-appearing colonic mass. Surgical consultation is recommended.]

CTC screening

STUDY: Screening CT Colonography

NOTE: CT Colonography has been shown in several studies to have high sensitivity in certain patient groups. Although the experience with this test is promising, the precise role of CT Colonography has not been established, particularly for lesions measuring 5 mm or less and for non-polypoid (flat) lesions. CT colonography is not intended for the detection of diminutive colonic polyps (i.e., tiny polyps <= 5 mm), the presence or absence of which will not change management of the patient.

INDICATION:  [Asymptomatic patient screening for colorectal cancer.] 

TECHNIQUE: The patient underwent bowel preparation the day before the exam, consisting of [ ]. Following automated carbon dioxide insufflation per rectum, supine and prone CT images were obtained without intra venous contrast material administration. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were performed on the CT console by the technologist. Additional 3D images were performed and evaluated using a dedicated 3D workstation by a radiologist to better assess the colon. Evaluation of the colon was performed using 2-D axial and multiplanar reformats, as well as 3-D images.

FINDINGS: 
Note: Extracolonic evaluation is limited by the low dose CT technique and lack of IV contrast.

incidental pulmonary nodule
Fleischner Society recommendations for Follow-up and Management of Pulmonary Nodules Detected Incidentally at Nonscreening CT are  based on nodule size and assessment of patient risk:

MacMahon H MB BCh, Austin J MD, Gamsu G MD, et al. Guidelines for Management of Small Pulmonary Nodules Detected on CT Scans: A Statement from the Fleischner Society. Radiology 2005; 237:395-400

Final determination of your patient's risk should include your clinical judgment. The decision to pursue further evaluation for an individual patient should also include consideration of the patient's co-morbid conditions, long-term prognosis, and preference.

*Fleischner Society recommendations for newly detected indeterminate nodule(s) in persons 35 years of age or older: 
1. Nodule Size (mm): <=4 
        Low-Risk Patient: No follow-up needed
        High-Risk Patient: Follow-up CT at 12 mo; if unchanged, no further follow-up
2. Nodule Size (mm): >4-6 
        Low-Risk Patient: Follow-up CT at 12 mo; if unchanged, no further follow-up
        High-Risk Patient: Initial follow-up CT at 6-12 mo then at 18-24 mo if no change
3. Nodule Size (mm): >6-8 
        Low-Risk Patient: Initial follow-up CT at 6-12 mo then at 18-24 mo if no change 
        High-Risk Patient: Initial follow-up CT at 3-6 mo then at 9-12 and 24 mo if no change
4. Nodule Size (mm): >8 
        Low-Risk Patient: Follow-up CT at around 3, 9, and 24 mo, dynamic contrast-enhanced CT, PET, and/or biopsy 
        High-Risk Patient: Same as for low-risk patient 

*Nodule size measured as average of length and width. ADOPTION OF THIS POLICY APPLIES ONLY TO FULLY SOLID NODULES. Ground glass and partly solid nodules are excluded from the Fleischner criteria. These may require longer follow-up to exclude indolent adenocarcinoma.

PET/CT Enterography
INDICATION: Crohn's disease.

This study was performed as part of a research protocol, F350514. There is no charge for the midportion of the study. The principal investigator is Paul Shyn MD.  Informed consent was obtained for this PHRC approved protocol.

A serum pregnancy test on the day of examination was negative. The patient received 13.0 mCi of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) intravenously. The contrast-enhanced CT portion of the study was obtained immediately prior to PET imaging on the PET/CT scanner.  See separately dictated CT enterography report. Approximately 90 minutes following FDG administration PET acquisitions were obtained with 4 minutes per bed position to include the abdomen and pelvis. The study is reviewed and PET-CT workstation including multiplanar displays.

There is diffuse moderate to intense FDG uptake throughout the distal one-third to one-half of the ileum. These bowel loops are located in the pelvis. The abnormal uptake extends all the way to the terminal ileum and ileocecal valve. The FDG uptake corresponds to areas of abnormality on CT Enterography. The there is  additional intense FDG uptake within a left perianal fistula which contains a seton. Mild to moderate FDG uptake throughout the rectum is not greater than commonly seen with physiologic uptake. Uptake in the remainder of the visualized bowel is normal.

No abnormal uptake identified in association with reactive mesenteric lymph nodes or the 1 cm peritoneal nodule in the right.

CONCLUSION: Abnormal FDG uptake corresponding to the distal one-third to one-half of the ileum including the terminal ileum and ileocecal valve. Findings likely reflect active inflammation of known Crohn's disease.

PET/CT Intervention
INDICATION: Multiple hepatic lesions. PET-CT guided biopsy for diagnosis. History Peutz Jegher syndrome.

RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL: The 18-F fluoro-deoxyglucose, 14.5 mCi.

Informed consent was obtained for this PHRC-approved PET-CT interventional research protocol, F8351009. The principal investigator is Paul Shyn, M.D. Limited PET/CT of the liver was performed for liver biopsy guidance. The interventional procedural portion of the study is dictated separately.

Preliminary noncontrast CT scanning of the upper abdomen was performed. PET imaging was obtained approximately 60 minutes following the IV administration FDG. Single bed position PET acquisitions over the upper abdomen were obtained.  Attenuation correction of PET images using the CT dataset was performed.

FINDINGS:

There are numerous focal lesions throughout all segments of the liver. These liver lesions demonstrate moderate to intense FDG uptake of and are suspicious for malignancy. Within the limited field-of-view, there is physiologic bowel activity identified. One focus of moderate intensity FDG uptake is identified in the midabdomen near the inferior limit of the field-of-view. This appears to correspond to a thickened small bowel loop as seen on recent CT Enterography.  The uptake is nonspecific and may reflect known polyposis, physiologic activity, inflammation, or possibly a bowel primary tumor. Other hamartomatous polys within the field of view are not significantly FDG-avid, however, which raises the suspicion of a potential bowel primary in the focus described above.  No other focus of abnormal FDG uptake identified.  

There is evidence of previous cholecystectomy.  Degerative changes noted in the lumbar spine.
