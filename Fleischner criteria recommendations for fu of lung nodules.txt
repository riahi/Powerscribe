If not previously performed, these may be further evaluated as follows, according 
to Fleischner criteria recommendations for follow-up of incidental CT nodules (H MacMahon, Guidelines for management of small pulmonary nodules detected on CT scans: A statement from the Fleischner Society, Radiology 237: 395-400 2005): 

Low Risk Patient: Minimal or no smoking or other known risk factors for malignancy 
 <=4 mm: No follow-up needed. 
 >4-6 mm: Initial follow-up CT at 12 months; if unchanged, no further follow-up. 
 >6-8 mm: Initial follow-up CT at 6-12 months then at 18-24 mo if no change. 
 >8 mm: follow-up CT at \R\3, 9, 24 months, or PET and/or biopsy. 


 High Risk Patient: History of smoking or other known risk factors 
 <=4 mm: Follow-up at 12 months; if unchanged, no further follow-up. 
 >4-6 mm: Initial follow-up CT at 6-12 months then at 18-24 months if no change. 
 >6-8 mm: Initial follow-up CT at 3-6 months then at 9-12 and 24 months if no change. 
 >8 mm: Same as low risk patient. 

 Note: Nodule size measured as average of length and width. 
Ground glass or partly solid nodules may require longer follow-up 
to exclude indolent adenocarcinoma.
