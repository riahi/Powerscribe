HISTORY: 

TECHNIQUE: Oral barium contrast / water soluble contrast was administered. Multiple radiographs of the abdomen at timed intervals were obtained. Once the contrast reached the large bowel, spot radiographs of ileocecal region were obtained.

FINDINGS: 
The mucosal fold pattern of the stomach and duodenum is within normal limits. 

Contrast passes readily into the small bowel without obstruction or delay. 

The small bowel including the terminal ileum demonstrates a normal caliber, course, and contour. 

Normal distensibility is seen without obstruction or strictures. 

Ileocecal junction appears normal.

Transit time to the large bowel is within normal limits.

IMPRESSION: 
Normal small bowel follow-through.
