INDICATION: Screening for colorectal cancer.

PREPARATION: The patient was instructed to consume a low fiber diet followed by a bowel cleansing regimen. The patient reported successful results of the bowel cleansing regimen.

TECHNIQUE: A balloon tipped rectal catheter was placed into the rectum and connected to an automated carbon dioxide insufflator. The colon was insufflated with carbon dioxide to an appropriate pressure and to the patient's tolerance. A CT scout was performed to confirm adequate distention of the colon. CT of the abdomen and pelvis was then performed in the supine and prone positions. Evaluation of the colon was performed using 2-D as well as virtual colonoscopy 3-D images.

FINDINGS:

Limited images through lung bases reveal  


Abdomen:  The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, and adrenal glands demonstrate no abnormality.  The stomach, small bowel, and large bowel within the abdomen demonstrate no abnormality.  


Pelvis: 

The small and large bowel within the pelvis demonstrate no abnormality.  Pelvic and inguinal lymph nodes are not enlarged.  

Soft Tissues and Bones:  


MULTIPLANAR 3-D RECONSTRUCTIONS AND VIRTUAL COLONOSCOPY: 


IMPRESSION:


FOLLOWUP RECOMMENDATION:
[No polyps identified.
Recommend continued colorectal cancer screening with conventional colonoscopy and 7 years. CT Colonography can be substituted for conventional colonoscopy the patient is either unable or unwilling to undergo conventional colonoscopy.]

[Multiple (greater than 3) small (less than 5 mm) polyps were detected.
The patient should undergo colonoscopy (virtual or endoscopic) and more frequent intervals. The patient should return for colonoscopy and 5 years. CT Colonography  can be substituted for conventional colonoscopy the patient is either unable or unwilling to undergo conventional colonoscopy. However endoscopy with possible pulpectomy could be performed at the current time based on physician or patient preference.]

[Polyps between 5 and 10 mm were identified.
The decision to perform immediate pulpectomy should be based on patient and physician preference as well as the presence of comorbid conditions. If polypectomy is not performed at the present time, the patient should undergo colonoscopy at a diminished interval not to exceed 3 years. CT Colonography  cab be substituted for conventional colonoscopy if the patient is unable or unwilling to undergo conventional colonoscopy.]

[Polyps greater than 10 mm were detected.
Immediate endoscopy with polypectomy is recommended.]

[Small to minimal amount of retained stool was present and/or air insufflation was not adequate.
Sensitivity for small to moderate sized polyps or cancers is diminished due to retained stool or insufficient distention. Recommend continued colorectal cancer screening with conventional colonoscopy in 3 years. CT Colonography can be substituted for conventional colonoscopy if the patient is either unable or unwilling to undergo conventional colonoscopy.]

[Moderate to large amount of retained fecal material was present and/or air insufflation was not adequate.
The retained stool and/or insufficient distention severely limit the evaluation for polyps. No large lesions are identified, however the exam is insufficient to exclude polyps or cancers under several centimeters in size. The patient should undergo conventional colonoscopy after a sufficient colonic preparation. CT Colonography can be substituted for conventional colonoscopy if the patient is either unable or unwilling to undergo conventional colonoscopy.]
