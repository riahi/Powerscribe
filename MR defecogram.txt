INDICATION:  [ ]

TECHNIQUE: TECHNIQUE: Prior to the examination the patient drank 600 cc of water and 240 cc of ultrasound gel was administered intrarectally. Multiple MR images were obtained in a 1.5 Tesla magnet of the patient at rest, squeezing, and straining.

FINDINGS:

Rest (Images []): Rest images showed normal positions of the bladder, [], and anorectal junction in correlation with the pubococcygeal line. The anorectal junction projects approximately [] cm below the pubococcygeal line.

Squeezing (Images []): There is a normal indentation of the puborectalis muscle on the back wall of the rectum with the patient squeezing. There is an elevation of the anorectal junction to approximately [] centimeters below the pubococcygeal line.  The bladder and [] stay in a normal position.

Straining (Images []):  There is a normal distance of the anorectal junction descending [] cm below the pubococcygeal line. There is widening of the anorectal angle. The bladder and [] stay in normal position.  

Defecation (Images []):  There is [] descent of the bladder with the bladder base descending [] cm below the pubococcygeal line. []


IMPRESSION: 
[]  Pelvic prolapse with abnormal descent of the anterior, middle, and posterior compartments.
