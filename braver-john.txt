$$$
fluoro barium enema
HISTORY: [<>]

TECHNIQUE: Water soluble contrast is instilled via a red rubber tube inserted into the anus under fluoroscopic guidance.

FINDINGS: [<Contrast is followed from the rectum through the colon into the cecum.>]  [<The colon appears normal in appearance with normal caliber and fold pattern.>]  [<No filling defects are seen to suggest polyps or mass lesions.>]  [<No contrast extravasation or fistula formation is seen.>]  

IMPRESSION: [<Normal barium enema.>]
$$$
fluoro cysto
HISTORY: [<>}

TECHNIQUE: A preliminary film of the abdomen was obtained. Using sterile technique, the urethra was catheterized and Cystografin Dilute (8.5% of iodine) were instilled under gravity. Multiple films were obtained.

FINDINGS: The urinary bladder is normal in size, shape, and position. There is no evidence of vesicoureteral reflux.The urethra is normal. The patient voids to completion.

IMPRESSION: Normal voiding cystourethrogram.
$$$
fluoro double contrast
HISTORY: [<>]

TECHNIQUE: The patient swallows barium and citrocarbonate under fluoroscopic guidance.  The patient is then given thin barium to swallow. 

FINDINGS: [<The patient swallows barium without difficulty.>] [<There is no evidence of hiatus hernia or gastroesophageal reflux.>] [<Esophageal motility is normal.>] Contrast is followed from the esophagus to the stomach and into the duodenum. The stomach and the duodenum appear normal.

IMPRESSION: [<Normal upper GI study.>]
$$$
fluoro ERCP
HISTORY: [<>]

TECHNIQUE: [<>] radiographs were obtained of the upper abdomen after cannulation of the common bile duct by the gastroenterologist.

FINDINGS: Contrast opacified a nondilated biliary tree. The common duct is not dilated. No filling defects are seen. [<Basket retrieval of stone was performed.>]

IMPRESSIONS: [<Normal ERCP.>] [<Choledocholithiasis status post extraction of stones.>]
$$$
fluoro gastric banding
HISTORY: Patient is [] from gastric banding.

TECHNIQUE: The patient is given water soluble contrast to drink under fluoroscopic guidance.

FINDINGS: Contrast passes [<easily/with slight delay/after significant delay>] through the gastroesophageal junction.  The gastric band has appropriate alignment.  Contrast passes through the banded segment in an appropriately timely manner and proceeds into the small bowel.  

IMPRESSION: No evidence for leak or obstruction.
$$$
fluoro gastric bypass
HISTORY: Patient is [] from Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.

TECHNIQUE: The patient is given water soluble contrast to drink under fluoroscopic guidance.

FINDINGS: Contrast passes [easily/with slight delay/after significant delay] through the gastroesophageal junction.  Contrast passes through the gastrojejunostomy anastamosis [without delay].  There is no evidence for extraluminal leak or extravasation into the excluded stomach.  Contrast continues down into non-dilated distal small bowel.  

IMPRESSION: No evidence for leak or obstruction.
$$$
fluoro HSG
HISTORY: [Infertility.]

TECHNIQUE: The cervix was cannulated by the obstetrician-gynecologist and water soluble contrast was instilled into the uterus under fluoroscopic guidance.  Multiple spot images were obtained.

FINDINGS:  The uterine cavity is normal in size, shape, and position.  The fallopian tubes are patent and there is free peritoneal spill bilaterally.  Visualized bony structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:  Normal hysterosalpingogram.
$$$
fluoro rad to do
HISTORY: [<>] female with infertility.

TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique, an 8 French HSG catheter was placed into the cervix and the balloon gently inflated to tamponade the cervical canal. Under fluoroscopic control, Hypaque was infused.

FINDINGS:  The uterine cavity is normal in size, shape, and position.  The fallopian tubes are patent and there is free peritoneal spill bilaterally without evidence of loculation.  Visualized bony structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:  Normal hysterosalpingogram.
$$$
fluoro SBFT
HISTORY: [<>]

TECHNIQUE: The patient swallows barium and multiple abdominal radiographs are obtained at different time intervals to assess the bowel pattern and the transit of contrast.

FINDINGS: Barium is followed through the small bowel to the colon. The small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber and fold pattern. In particular, the terminal ileum appears within normal limits.

IMPRESSION: [<Normal small bowel follow through study.>]
$$$
fluoro UGI
HISTORY: [<Obesity, preop evaluation>][<Epigastric pain>].

TECHNIQUE: The patient was given oral barium contrast to swallow under fluoroscopic observation. Multiple spot radiographs were obtained of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.

FINDINGS: The esophagus is normal in distensibility and contour. Contrast passes readily into the stomach without delay. Gastric and duodenal mucosal fold patterns are within normal limits.  No hiatal hernia is present.  No gastroesophageal reflux is observed during the examination.

IMPRESSION: [<Normal upper gastrointestinal series.>]
$$$
fluoro VCUG
HISTORY: [<>]

TECHNIQUE: The patient is catheterized by the urology nurse and water soluble contrast is injected into the bladder in retrograde manner under fluoroscopic guidance.  Spot images are taken during filling and voiding.

FINDINGS: The patient's bladder fills without difficulty.  [<There is no leak with cough or strain.>]  There are no trabeculations or diverticula.  The patient voids without difficulty.  The urethra is normal in course and appearance.  There is no reflux.  There is no significant post void residual.

IMPRESSION: Normal VCUG.

IMPRESSION: [  ]

$$$
video swallow
INDICATION: <<Order Reason for Study>>  <<Clinical Information>> 

TECHNIQUE: The patient was given multiple consistencies of oral barium by the speech pathologist. Video sequences were obtained in the lateral position during swallowing.

FINDINGS: Bolus handling is within normal limits.  No significant laryngeal penetration or subglottic aspiration was observed during the examination. No significant residue was present after swallowing.

IMPRESSION: [<No evidence of aspiration.>]
