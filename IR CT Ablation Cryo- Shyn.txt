PROCEDURE:  
Percutaneous tumor ablation of [a left kidney mass] [under general anesthesia].

HISTORY: 
[A 45-year-old male with biopsy-proven left papillary renal cell carcinoma.] The patient felt not to be a ideal surgical candidate. Patient referred for cryoablation.

OPERATIVE REPORT:
Preparation: 
The procedure, risks, benefits alternatives were discussed with patient and written informed consent was obtained. Timeout was performed to verify patient identity and site of procedure. Patient was placed in the [prone] position. Targeting and approach was finalized. The local area was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. 

[General anesthesia was provided by the anesthesiologist.]

Procedure:
With the use of CT fluoroscopy [three] Galli ice sphere cryoprobes were placed into the region of the [left renal tumor]. A 15 - 10 - 15 minute, freeze - thaw - freeze cycle was then applied. Intra procedural CT monitoring demonstrates good coverage of the tumor with the ice ball. 

The postprocedural scan demonstrated no evidence of hemorrhage or focal fluid collections. The adjacent visceral organs also appeared unremarkable.

Dr. Shyn was present and performed the procedure.

IMPRESSION: 
Cryoablation of left renal tumor without difficulty.

FOLLOW-UP:
Patient will be sent to the PACU  for close monitoring post procedure. Subsequently, the patient will be observed overnight.  Patient is scheduled for an MRI in the morning.
