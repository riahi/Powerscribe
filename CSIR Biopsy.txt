DEVICES:  []

SEDATION/ANESTHESIA: [IV conscious sedation administered and monitored by the radiology department nurse with supervision by the radiologist; Monitored anesthesia care provided by the anesthesia department; General anesthesia provided by the anesthesia department]

MEDICATIONS AND DOSAGES: Midazolam [] mg IV, fentanyl [] ug IV; 2% lidocaine and sodium bicarbonate in a 4:1 mixture, [] ml for subcutaneous local anesthesia

IMAGING FINDINGS:  []

PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:
The patient was brought into the [CT] suite and a time-out was performed. The patient was positioned [] on the table. [A radiopaque grid was placed on the [] overlying the planned entry site.] Limited [CT] imaging was then obtained to determine a safe needle entry site.  The entry site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Subcutaneous 2% lidocaine was used for local anesthesia along the expected needle tract. 

Using [CT]-guidance, a []-gauge []cm [Chiba needle] was inserted into the [] towards the [] and the position was confirmed with CT. Next, a []-gauge []cm [Chiba needle] was placed [tandem to/ coaxially through] the needle. [CT] guidance was used to confirm needle placements in the mass. Next, the biopsy needle was used to obtain [fine needle aspiration] biopsy specimen. This process was repeated [] more for a total of [] [fine needle aspiration] biopsy specimens. The patient tolerated the procedure well 

SPECIMENS SUBMITTED: [Cytopathology, histopathology, microbiology, chemistry, other]

POST-PROCEDURE IMAGING: [CT] images obtained at the conclusion of the procedure demonstrate no evidence for hematoma or other postprocedural complication. 

COMPLICATIONS: [No immediate complications noted at the conclusion of the procedure. A two hour post-procedure chest x-ray is ordered         ]

FOLLOW-UP PLAN:  Patient was observed in the radiology recovery room for a period of [] hours before being discharged in stable condition. Patient will follow up with the ordering clinician.
