IMAGING FINDINGS:  []

PROCEDURE #1:
Preliminary ultrasound imaging was used to assess the pleural fluid collection and to plan the approach.  With the patient sitting in an upright position, arms resting on a table, the skin over the [right/left] posterior chest wall was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The local anesthetic solution was injected into the skin and subcutaneous tissues.  A small incision was made followed by ultrasound-guided insertion of a 5 Fr centesis catheter over the top of the rib into the pleural fluid.  [] ml of [] fluid were removed followed by catheter removal.  A sterile bandage was applied.
	
SPECIMENS SENT:[none, cytology, histopathology, microbiology, chemistry, other]

COMPLICATIONS:  [The patient tolerated the procedure well and no immediate complications occurred.  The patient experienced mild coughing and chest discomfort on the side of the procedure which promptly resolved.]
