INDICATION: Multiple hepatic lesions. PET-CT guided biopsy for diagnosis. History Peutz Jegher syndrome.

RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL: The 18-F fluoro-deoxyglucose, 14.5 mCi.

Informed consent was obtained for this PHRC-approved PET-CT interventional research protocol, F8351009. The principal investigator is Paul Shyn, M.D. Limited PET/CT of the liver was performed for liver biopsy guidance. The interventional procedural portion of the study is dictated separately.

Preliminary noncontrast CT scanning of the upper abdomen was performed. PET imaging was obtained approximately 60 minutes following the IV administration FDG. Single bed position PET acquisitions over the upper abdomen were obtained.  Attenuation correction of PET images using the CT dataset was performed.

FINDINGS:

There are numerous focal lesions throughout all segments of the liver. These liver lesions demonstrate moderate to intense FDG uptake of and are suspicious for malignancy. Within the limited field-of-view, there is physiologic bowel activity identified. One focus of moderate intensity FDG uptake is identified in the midabdomen near the inferior limit of the field-of-view. This appears to correspond to a thickened small bowel loop as seen on recent CT Enterography.  The uptake is nonspecific and may reflect known polyposis, physiologic activity, inflammation, or possibly a bowel primary tumor. Other hamartomatous polys within the field of view are not significantly FDG-avid, however, which raises the suspicion of a potential bowel primary in the focus described above.  No other focus of abnormal FDG uptake identified.  

There is evidence of previous cholecystectomy.  Degerative changes noted in the lumbar spine.

CONCLUSION:
