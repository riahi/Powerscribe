Drainage

IMPRESSION: CT-guided catheter drainage of []. A sample of the aspirated fluid was sent for microbiology. A [] Fr catheter was left to gravity drainage. This catheter will be left in place and orders for catheter irrigation with sterile saline and monitoring of catheter outputs q shift have been written. When catheter output is less than 10 cc of nonpurulent fluid per day for at least 2 consecutive days, a follow-up CT scan will be considered to assess for fluid collection resolution. When the collection is considered fully drained, an abscessagram done under fluoroscopy will be considered to evaluate for an ongoing fistula. When the patient is planned for discharge, and if the catheter is still in place, please notify the CSIR team (B 14520) so that we can plan for outpatient follow-up.
